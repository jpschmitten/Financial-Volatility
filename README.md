## About the paper
The goal of this paper is to show how forecasted volatilities can be used to better document the predictive power of Greeks on the price of the underlying asset. by forecasting financial volatility, we argue to get more precise volatility estimates compared to implied volatility. We use the predicted volatility to get accurate option prices and Greeks. Moreover, we show that the predicted Greeks can consistently predict the openings of the underlying asset via thresholds in the Net Option Pricing Effect (NOPE) and Gamma Exposure (GEX). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ GARCH-type volatility prediction models to complement and improve models which account for the effect delta-gamma hedging has on the price of the underlying.
